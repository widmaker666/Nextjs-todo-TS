![ToDo List App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This repository contains a ToDo List application built using Next.js and TypeScript. The app enables users to effectively manage their tasks by providing features to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The project follows a clean and organized architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Use the "Add Task" input field to seamlessly insert new tasks into your list.

- **Delete Tasks:** Effortlessly remove tasks that are no longer needed by utilizing the delete button associated with each task.

- **Mark as Completed:** Keep track of completed tasks by toggling their status.

## Architecture Overview

The project is structured in the following manner:

- `components`: This directory houses reusable React components that contribute to the overall user interface.

- `pages`: Contains the main Next.js page components. Each file in this directory corresponds to a different route or page of the application. For example, the `index.tsx` file handles the main ToDo List page.

- `public`: This directory is used to store static assets like images, which can be referenced within your components and pages.

- `styles`: Consists of CSS module files that provide scoped styles for individual components, ensuring separation of concerns and preventing style conflicts.

- `utils`: Contains utility functions, constants, or helper modules that are used across the application.
